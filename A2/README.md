## Setting Up the Python Virtual Environment

To set up the Python virtual environment with all the necessary packages, follow the steps below:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Special Notes
- **mlrose**: This package has been installed for part 1. It includes many optimization problems, fitness functions, and optimization algorithms. You can find the original GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/gkhayes/mlrose).
- **pyperch**: This package has been cloned and used for part 2. It defines neural network model classifiers that can easily switch the weight-tuning algorithms from backpropagation to optimization algorithms such as RHC, SA, and GA. The original GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pyperch).

## Part 1: Randomized Optimization

All code related to Part 1 is included under the `part1` folder. Below is a detailed description of the structure and components:

### *Executable* Algorithm Scripts
The following scripts implement the respective algorithms:
1. **ga.py**: Implements the Genetic Algorithm.
2. **mimic.py**: Implements the MIMIC algorithm.
3. **rhc.py**: Implements Randomized Hill Climbing.
4. **sa.py**: Implements Simulated Annealing.

### Optimization Problems
Optimization problems are defined in the `problems.py` script. These problems can be called by the algorithm scripts to ensure consistency and facilitate easier cross-comparison of results.

### Shared Plotting Logic
Shared plotting logic is included in the `utils.py` script. This script contains functions for generating plots and visualizations from the results.

### Configuration Files
Configuration files are defined in `configs.json5`. These files contain the parameters and settings for running the optimization algorithms.

### Generated Data
Generated data is stored in CSV format under the `optimization_results` folder. This folder also contains the generated plots and images. The results are organized by algorithm (`rhc`, `ga`, etc.) and problem type (`simple` or `complex`)

```

### Running the Code
To run the scripts, use the following commands:

```bash
# Part1
cd part1

# For Genetic Algorithm
python ga.py

# For MIMIC Algorithm
python mimic.py

# For Randomized Hill Climbing
python rhc.py

# For Simulated Annealing
python sa.py
```

Each script will read the problem definitions from `problems.py`, use the configurations specified in `configs.json5`, and save the results in the `optimization_results` folder.

If you want to change the hyper parameters (required for GA and MIMIC as they have two parameters to tune), you need to comment out/in the problem solving and plotting sections:
- You have to choose which parameter you want to fix and the other parameter you want to test, you can choose either the 1 or 2 in the example below
- When plotting, you have to change the `attribute_col` and `attribute` corresponding to the hyper parameter you are testing
- Same logic applies for MIMIC

```python
# For example GA
# 1. fixed population
population_sizes = [10]
mutation_rates = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

# 2. fixed mutation_rates
population_sizes = range(10, 200, 50)
mutation_rates = [0.1]

# ...
plot_op_results(
    results=mimic_knapsack_complex_results,
    problem_name="knapsack-complex",
    attribute_col="Keep Percent",
    attribute="keep_percentage",
    algorithm="mimic",
    iteration_list=iteration_list,
)

plot_op_results(
    results=mimic_knapsack_complex_results,
    problem_name="knapsack-complex",
    attribute_col="Population Size",
    attribute="population",
    algorithm="mimic",
    iteration_list=iteration_list,
)
```

### Data and Results
- Generated data (CSV files) and plots (images) are stored in the `optimization_results` folder.
- The results are organized into subfolders by algorithm and problem type, facilitating easy access and comparison.
